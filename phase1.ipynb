The silicone gasket that wraps around the phone never stays in place, as well as the port covers. This product lets in a lot of dust and then traps it.  Look for another product to protect your iPhone.\n",

It's a bit bulky, but that's to be expected from a Defender series case. Installation was EASY. No problems, no difficulties. Like I said above, it only took around 30 seconds to insert the phone and secure the case. The case gives easy access to all the ports while keeping them blocked from lint, etc. when they're not in use. The screen protector is a nice feature as well.No complaints!\n",
