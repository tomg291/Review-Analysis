    "BERTopic has successfully modelled topics discussed within the reviews, but I don't feel convinced that this is good for aspect discovery in my app. Of the above keywords from different topics only a few of them (namely \"color\", \"flap\", \"rubber\", \"holster\", \"bulky\", \"protection\") would be useful as aspects. I don't know how I could automate the listing of aspects from here. The only route I see from here would be to get the LLM topic representations working, but I would need to setup my own local LLM for that first (of course I could pay for OpenAI credits but I don't want to)."
